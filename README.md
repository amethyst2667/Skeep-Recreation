# Skeep-Recreation

Skeep-Recreation is a project recreating the original Skype 5 client for use with more modern Programming standards, Modern Networking, etc.

Our main goal with this project is to learn more about VoIP and running a large scale server for individuals accessing a system. And also have a functional recreation while the Skeep Project is worked on.
